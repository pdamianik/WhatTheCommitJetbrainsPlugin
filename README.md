# What The Commit Jetbrains Plugin

This project is, as the title suggests, a jetbrains plugin version of the [What The Commit vscode extension](https://github.com/Gaardsholt/vscode-whatthecommit).
This code uses, similar to the vscode extension, the http://whatthecommit.com/ website, to be more precise the file http://whatthecommit.com/index.txt to fetch random git commit messages with a button that this plugins adds to the git commit panel.
The project related to the http://whatthecommit.com/ website can be found under: https://github.com/pdamianik/WhatTheCommitJetbrainsPlugin. All the credit for the messages goes to the creators/editors of this repository.

The button can be found above the git message box and looks like a file icon.

## IMPORTANT

Another project which has already been done by somebody else [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7536-what-the-commit/). Seems like I didn't research enough. Well, I can't change anything about that, but at least I learned the basics of Jetbrains plugins.
